### **Brief explaination of projects listed in the repository:** 

* **P1-BaseConv.py:**
My very first project in Python(completed on July 28 2017).It's a converter that takes an ASCII character and converts to user's choice (either binary,decimal,octal,or hex).The options menu has been made as user-friendly as possible.

* **P2-AreaCircum.py:**
Another project,completed on July 28 2017,to calculate area and circumference of square,triangle,rectangle,or circle.An options menu is printed for the user to make a choice and enter the dimension(s) of the chosen shape.

* **P3.EngCalc.py:**
Sometimes in electrical engineering projects calculating power,current,resistance,reactance,and inductance can be just too much to do.To avoid this problem,I made this project on August 3 2017.Again,a user-friendly menu is printed to show options for the user and depending on the choice of the user the component values/circuit properties are asked to be entered.

* **P4-RectPolar.py:**
In calculus,rectangular to polar conversion (or vice versa) can be very tricky to do by hand,especially without a calculator.In order to have a program handy,I made this imaginary number converter from Rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular.It was fun! I completed it on August 8 2017.
